# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Burp MCP Agents.

## How to contribute

- Open an issue first for feature requests or behavior changes.
- Keep PRs focused and minimal; avoid sweeping refactors.
- Prefer clear docs and small scripts over complex automation.
- Include before/after behavior notes for changes to prompts or agents.

## Support boundaries

- This repo does not provide legal or compliance advice.
- The maintainers may decline features that increase risk or misuse.

## Development notes

- Use ASCII in docs and scripts where possible.
- Follow existing structure: `common/`, `prompts/`, and backend folders.
- Test locally where practical and document any manual verification steps.
